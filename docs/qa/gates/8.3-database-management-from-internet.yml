    status: PASS
    notes: 'Background downloads, 500ms progress interval, direct DB close/open on switch, no N+1 queries'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Proper error handling in service/slice/UI layers. Atomic active-DB transaction. File existence check before unlink. Error cleared on next operation.'
