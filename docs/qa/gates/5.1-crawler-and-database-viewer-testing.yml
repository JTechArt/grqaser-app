gate: PASS
status_reason: "Crawler unit tests (text-cleaner, duration-parser, book-validator, url-validator), API route tests (books, stats, crawler, health), single-command and CI job implemented; ACs met. Local run failed only due to Node/better-sqlite3 ABI mismatch (documented in story); CI is authoritative."
