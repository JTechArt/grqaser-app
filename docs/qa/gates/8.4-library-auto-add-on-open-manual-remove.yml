  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Library data is local-only, no network sync, no sensitive data exposed. Input is book IDs from existing catalog.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Upsert prevents duplicate inserts. useEffect dependency fixed to prevent unnecessary dispatches. Re-fetch after add acceptable for expected library sizes.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Error banner with retry button added in LibraryScreen. Loading spinner for initial load. Graceful handling of DB failures.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean Redux Toolkit patterns, proper separation (repository → slice → screen). Unit + integration test coverage thorough. ESLint clean. Type now matches DB schema.'
