# Implementation Readiness: Story 1.2

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 1.2 — Full catalog and pagination  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-14

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. All referenced architecture docs exist, file paths match the repo, and the story correctly depends on 1.1.

---

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | data-models-and-schema, crawler-pipeline-and-data-contract, tech-stack, source-tree, coding-standards, testing-and-deployment-strategy |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | Data contract, URL queue, crawl logs, phase order align with docs |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` point to real sections |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Phase 1 only; no database-viewer or GrqaserApp dependencies |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Crawler entry | ✅ | `crawler/src/crawler.js` exists |
| Config | ✅ | `crawler/src/config/crawler-config.js` (rate limit, delays, DB path, logging) |
| DB layer | ✅ | `crawler/src/models/database.js` |
| URL queue | ✅ | `crawler/src/utils/url-queue-manager.js` exists |
| DB file / logs | ✅ | `crawler/data/grqaser.db`; `crawler/logs/` optional per architecture |
| Test layout | ✅ | `npm test` from `crawler/`; Jest per tech stack |

---

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: Pagination and rate limiting | Task 1 | Listing/detail pagination; configurable rate limiting in crawler-config.js |
| AC2: Full catalog, no duplicates | Task 2 | 950+ target; dedup by unique ID or URL |
| AC3: Complete metadata and audio URLs per book | Task 2 | Builds on Story 1.1 schema |
| AC4: Progress and errors loggable / visible | Task 3 | crawl_logs or log format for later viewer exposure |

Task order is logical. Testing: unit or integration for pagination/rate limits; integration for DB and full-catalog/dedup.

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- Node.js, Puppeteer, SQLite; timeouts and retries (e.g. 30s, 3 retries); config over hardcoding — matches [tech-stack.md](../architecture/tech-stack.md) and [coding-standards.md](../architecture/coding-standards.md).

---

## 5. Recommendations

- Ensure rate limiting (delays, concurrency) is configurable in `crawler-config.js` as stated in the story and crawler-pipeline doc.
- Integration test should assert crawl volume and absence of duplicate books (e.g. by id or URL).

---

## 6. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 1.2 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependency:** Builds on Story 1.1 (schema and extraction).  
- **No blocking gaps.** All refs and paths verified.
