# Implementation Readiness: Story 3.4

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 3.4 — Home and book detail UI  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-14

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. All referenced architecture docs exist; GrqaserApp has `src/screens/` (e.g. HomeScreen); state and services from 3.3 feed the UI.

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio, data-models-and-schema, source-tree, coding-standards, testing-and-deployment-strategy |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | Home (featured/categories); Book detail (metadata, ready for Play); pull-to-refresh |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` point to real sections |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Phase 3; builds on 3.3 |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Screens | ✅ | `GrqaserApp/src/screens/` (Home, BookDetail or equivalent) |
| Data source | ✅ | Redux/store and services from 3.3 |

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: Home shows catalog (featured and/or categories) | Task 1 | From integrated data (state/API from 3.3) |
| AC2: Book detail shows metadata; ready for Play | Task 2 | Title, author, description, duration, etc.; button/area for Epic 4 |
| AC3: Pull-to-refresh on Home (and list views) | Task 3 | Trigger refetch; update UI |

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- TypeScript; Redux/state for data; clear loading and error feedback — [coding-standards.md](../architecture/coding-standards.md).

---

## 5. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 3.4 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependency:** Story 3.3 (state and data services).  
- **No blocking gaps.** All refs and paths verified.
