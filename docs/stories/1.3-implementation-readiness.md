# Implementation Readiness: Story 1.3

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 1.3 — Search and categories/authors  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-14

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. All referenced architecture docs exist, file paths match the repo, and the story correctly builds on 1.1 and 1.2.

---

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | data-models-and-schema, crawler-pipeline-and-data-contract, coding-standards, testing-and-deployment-strategy |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | Books with category/author links; relationships for filtering/stats |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` point to real sections |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Phase 1 only |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Crawler entry | ✅ | `crawler/src/crawler.js` |
| Config | ✅ | `crawler/src/config/crawler-config.js` |
| DB layer | ✅ | `crawler/src/models/database.js` (books + any category/author tables) |
| URL queue | ✅ | `crawler/src/utils/url-queue-manager.js` |
| Test layout | ✅ | `npm test` from `crawler/` |

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: Search flow, merge without duplicates | Task 1 | Site search; merge results; dedup by book ID/URL |
| AC2: Categories and authors extracted and linked | Task 2 | Columns or related tables per data-models; referential consistency |
| AC3: Relationships support filtering and stats | Task 3 | Schema supports viewer and app queries (e.g. books by category, author counts) |

Data-models-and-schema allows categories/authors as columns or normalized tables; dev may choose and document.

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- Same as Epic 1: Node.js, Puppeteer, SQLite; no HTML in text fields; validate before write — [coding-standards.md](../architecture/coding-standards.md).

---

## 5. Recommendations

- Decide whether category/author are columns on `books` or separate tables; document in schema and keep relationships queryable for stats and filters.

---

## 6. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 1.3 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependencies:** Stories 1.1 and 1.2 (metadata, audio URLs, pagination, dedup).  
- **No blocking gaps.** All refs and paths verified.
