# Story 9.4: Library In-Progress Filter and Download Progress Fixes

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** mobile user,
**I want** the Library "In Progress" filter to show books I've started listening to, and the download progress on Book Detail to update in real-time,
**so that** I can easily find books I'm currently reading and see download status accurately.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Library In-Progress filter:** The "In Progress" filter on the Library screen shows books that have been partially played (i.e., playback position > 0 and < total duration). Currently it always shows empty.
2. **playProgress synced to Book state:** The `playProgress` field on Book objects in Redux state is populated from saved playback positions (stored in AsyncStorage via `preferencesStorage`), so Library and BookCard can use it.
3. **Download progress real-time update:** On the Book Detail screen, the download progress percentage updates in real-time during download (not just at start/end). Going back and re-entering the screen should show accurate downloaded/downloading state.
4. **Download completion reflected immediately:** When a download completes, the Book Detail screen immediately shows "Downloaded" with a checkmark without requiring the user to leave and return.
5. No regression in Library "All", "Favorites", and "Downloaded" filters, or in existing download/playback functionality.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Sync playProgress to Book objects in Redux (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] In `booksSlice.ts` or a new thunk, load saved playback positions from `preferencesStorage.getPlaybackPositions()` and merge them into the `books` array as `playProgress` values
  - [ ] Call this sync after `fetchBooks()` completes, and after playback stops/pauses (when position is saved)
  - [ ] Alternatively, add a `playProgress` merge in the Library screen's `useFocusEffect` so positions are fresh when the Library tab is focused
  - [ ] Ensure `playProgress` is a number in seconds matching what the `in_progress` filter expects

- [ ] Task 2: Fix Library In-Progress filter (AC: 1)
  - [ ] After Task 1, verify the existing filter logic works:
    ```typescript
    b.playProgress != null && b.playProgress > 0 &&
    b.duration != null && b.duration > 0 &&
    b.playProgress < b.duration
    ```
  - [ ] If `duration` is missing or 0 for some books, consider a fallback (e.g., treat any book with `playProgress > 0` as "in progress" when duration is unknown)
  - [ ] Test with at least 2 books: one partially played, one not started

- [ ] Task 3: Verify download progress updates in real-time (AC: 3)
  - [ ] In `BookDetailScreen.tsx`, verify that `downloadProgress` from `useSelector((s) => s.download.downloadingBooks[book.id])` updates reactively as `setDownloadProgress` is dispatched during download
  - [ ] If the component doesn't re-render on progress updates, check if the selector reference is stable (it should be since Redux dispatches `setDownloadProgress` with each callback)
  - [ ] Verify the percentage display `Math.round((downloadProgress?.fraction ?? 0) * 100)}%` updates visually during download

- [ ] Task 4: Ensure download completion is reflected immediately (AC: 4)
  - [ ] When `downloadBook.fulfilled` fires, `downloadingBooks[bookId]` is deleted and `downloadedBookIds` gets the new ID — verify this triggers a re-render on BookDetailScreen
  - [ ] The `isDownloaded` flag (`downloadedBookIds.includes(book.id)`) should flip to true and show the "Downloaded" state immediately
  - [ ] If there's a timing issue where the progress disappears but "Downloaded" doesn't show, add a brief loading/transition state

- [ ] Task 5: Verify no regressions (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Test Library "All" filter shows all library books
  - [ ] Test Library "Favorites" filter works correctly
  - [ ] Test Library "Downloaded" filter works correctly
  - [ ] Test downloading a book and verifying it appears in both "All" and "Downloaded"
  - [ ] Test existing playback is not affected by the playProgress sync

## Dev Notes

### Root Cause Analysis

**Library In-Progress empty:** The `playProgress` field on `Book` objects is defined in the type (`types/book.ts` line 15) but is **never populated**. The catalog database doesn't store playback progress — it's stored separately in AsyncStorage via `preferencesStorage.ts` as a `Record<string, number>` mapping bookId to position in seconds. Since `playProgress` is always `undefined`, the `in_progress` filter at `LibraryScreen.tsx` lines 72–78 returns an empty array.

The fix requires loading saved positions from `preferencesStorage.getPlaybackPositions()` and merging them into the Redux `books` array so that `playProgress` is populated.

**Download progress:** The download slice dispatches `setDownloadProgress({bookId, progress})` during download via the `downloadManager.downloadBookMp3s` callback. The BookDetailScreen reads this via `useSelector((s) => s.download.downloadingBooks[book.id])`. This should work reactively, but the issue may be related to:
- The progress callback not being called frequently enough
- The component not re-rendering because the book object reference from `route.params` doesn't change
- A timing gap between download completion (progress removed) and `downloadedBookIds` being updated

### Key Code References

**LibraryScreen.tsx** — lines 71–79: In-progress filter relies on `playProgress`:
```typescript
case 'in_progress':
  return libraryBooks.filter(
    b =>
      b.playProgress != null &&
      b.playProgress > 0 &&
      b.duration != null &&
      b.duration > 0 &&
      b.playProgress < b.duration,
  );
```

**Book type** — `types/book.ts` line 15:
```typescript
playProgress?: number; // in seconds — never populated from any data source
```

**BookDetailScreen.tsx** — lines 50, 187–202: Download progress display:
```typescript
const downloadProgress = book ? downloadingBooks[book.id] : undefined;
// ...
{isDownloading
  ? `${Math.round((downloadProgress?.fraction ?? 0) * 100)}%`
  : isDownloaded ? 'Downloaded' : 'Download'}
```

**downloadSlice.ts** — lines 126–131: Progress is stored per-book:
```typescript
setDownloadProgress: (state, action) => {
  state.downloadingBooks[action.payload.bookId] = action.payload.progress;
},
```

### Testing

- Play a book for at least 30 seconds, pause, go to Library, select "In Progress" filter — book should appear
- Play two books partially, verify both appear in "In Progress"
- Finish a book completely — it should NOT appear in "In Progress"
- Start a download on Book Detail, verify percentage updates from 0% to 100%
- When download completes, verify "Downloaded" with check icon appears immediately
- Navigate away during download and return — verify correct state is shown
