# Implementation Readiness: Story 2.3

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 2.3 — Web UI for books and crawler monitoring  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-14

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. All referenced architecture docs exist; database-viewer has `public/` and server; API endpoints from 2.1 and 2.2 are specified.

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | database-viewer-api-and-deployment, source-tree, tech-stack, coding-standards, testing-and-deployment-strategy |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | Dashboard, book list, crawler view; static assets in public/; consumes APIs from 2.1 and 2.2 |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` point to real sections |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Phase 2; builds on 2.1 and 2.2 |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Web UI | ✅ | `database-viewer/public/` (e.g. index.html); static assets served by Express |
| Entry | ✅ | `database-viewer/src/server.js` |
| API consumption | ✅ | UI calls books, search, books/:id, stats, crawler (status, urls, logs), health — same origin or CORS |

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: Dashboard with high-level stats | Task 1 | Book count, recent activity; use stats API; serve from public/ |
| AC2: Book list with filters/search, link to detail | Task 2 | GET /api/v1/books, search, /books/:id; desktop-first responsive |
| AC3: Crawler status and logs view | Task 3 | Dedicated view using crawler API |
| AC4: Usable on desktop (responsive) | Task 4 | Desktop-first admin experience; basic semantics |

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- Vanilla JS / HTML/CSS per [tech-stack.md](../architecture/tech-stack.md); CORS and config externalized — [coding-standards.md](../architecture/coding-standards.md).

---

## 5. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 2.3 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependencies:** Stories 2.1 and 2.2 (books/stats API, crawler/health API).  
- **No blocking gaps.** All refs and paths verified.
