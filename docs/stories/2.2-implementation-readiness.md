# Implementation Readiness: Story 2.2

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 2.2 — Crawler status API and health  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-14

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. All referenced architecture docs exist; database-viewer paths (server, config, routes, models) are present.

---

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | database-viewer-api-and-deployment, data-models-and-schema, coding-standards, testing-and-deployment-strategy |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | URL queue and crawl_logs read-only; crawler status/urls/logs; health with DB connectivity |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` point to real sections |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Phase 2; builds on 2.1 |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Entry | ✅ | `database-viewer/src/server.js` |
| Config | ✅ | `database-viewer/src/config/config.js` |
| Routes | ✅ | `database-viewer/src/routes/crawler.js` exists |
| Models | ✅ | `database-viewer/src/models/database.js` (read url_queue, crawl_logs) |
| Test layout | ✅ | `npm test` from `database-viewer/` |

---

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: Crawler status, URL queue, logs via API | Task 1 | e.g. /api/v1/crawler/status, /urls, /logs; read-only from crawler tables or log files |
| AC2: GET /api/v1/health (service + DB) | Task 2 | 200 when DB reachable; appropriate status when not |
| AC3: Config externalized (port, DB path, CORS, rate limit, logging) | Task 3 | Env or config (e.g. config.js); document or example env; no hardcoded paths/secrets |

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- Config over hardcoding; health must reflect DB connectivity — [coding-standards.md](../architecture/coding-standards.md).

---

## 5. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 2.2 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependency:** Story 2.1 (books and stats API).  
- **No blocking gaps.** All refs and paths verified.
