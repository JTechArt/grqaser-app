# Story 3.4: Home and book detail UI

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to see featured/categorized books on Home and full book information on a detail screen,  
**so that** I can choose what to listen to.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Home shows catalog content (e.g., featured list and/or categories) from the integrated data.
2. Book detail shows metadata (title, author, description, duration, etc.) and is ready for "Play" integration.
3. Pull-to-refresh updates the list where applicable.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Home screen content (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Home shows catalog content (featured list and/or categories) from integrated data (state/API from 3.3) ([Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md]).
  - [ ] Use books and any category/featured data from Redux or services.
- [ ] Task 2: Book detail screen (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Book detail shows metadata: title, author, description, duration, etc.; ready for "Play" integration (button/area for Epic 4) ([Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md]).
  - [ ] Load book by id from state or service; handle loading/error.
- [ ] Task 3: Pull-to-refresh (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add pull-to-refresh on Home (and list views where applicable) to refresh catalog data ([Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md]).
  - [ ] Trigger refetch in state/service and update UI.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 3.3 delivers state and data services. This story completes the browse flow: Home and Book detail with real data; Play will be added in Epic 4.

### Data Models

- **Book** metadata (title, author, description, duration, etc.) from [Source: docs/architecture/data-models-and-schema.md]. Display types align with API responses.

### File Locations

- **Screens:** `GrqaserApp/src/screens/` (Home, BookDetail or equivalent) ([Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]).

### Technical Constraints

- TypeScript; Redux/state for data; clear loading and error feedback ([Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]).

### Testing

- Unit/integration for components and data flow ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]). Run: `npm test` from `GrqaserApp/`.
