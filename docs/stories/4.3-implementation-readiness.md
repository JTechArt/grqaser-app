# Implementation Readiness: Story 4.3

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 4.3 — Progress and preferences  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-14

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. All referenced architecture docs exist; GrqaserApp has user slice and store; AsyncStorage/local for persistence is per tech stack.

---

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio, tech-stack, source-tree, testing-and-deployment-strategy |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | Favorites (book ids), theme (dark/light), playback position per book; AsyncStorage or local |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` point to real sections |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Builds on 4.1 and 4.2 |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| State | ✅ | `GrqaserApp/src/state/` or store (user slice for favorites, theme) — userSlice.ts present |
| Storage | ✅ | AsyncStorage or equivalent; services or state layer |

---

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: Playback position saved and restored per book/session | Task 1 | AsyncStorage or equivalent; restore on reopen |
| AC2: Favorites toggle and persist | Task 2 | Redux user slice + persist to AsyncStorage/local; restore on launch |
| AC3: Dark/light theme preference persisted | Task 3 | User state and AsyncStorage; apply to app theme (PRD FR13) |

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- AsyncStorage/local for persistence; Redux Toolkit for in-memory state — [tech-stack.md](../architecture/tech-stack.md), [grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md](../architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md).

---

## 5. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 4.3 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependencies:** Stories 4.1 and 4.2 (core player, background/controls).  
- **No blocking gaps.** All refs and paths verified.
