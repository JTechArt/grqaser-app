# Story 2.3: Web UI for books and crawler monitoring

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As an** operator,  
**I want** a web UI to browse books (list, filters, search), view stats, and see crawler status/logs,  
**so that** I can inspect data and pipeline health without using the API directly.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Dashboard shows high-level stats (e.g., book count, recent activity).
2. Book list supports filters and search and links to book detail where applicable.
3. A dedicated view shows crawler status and logs (or links to logs).
4. UI is usable on desktop (responsive admin experience).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Dashboard (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Build dashboard view showing high-level stats (e.g. book count, recent activity) using stats API ([Source: docs/architecture/database-viewer-api-and-deployment.md]).
  - [ ] Serve static assets from `database-viewer/public/` (e.g. `index.html`); consumed by Express ([Source: docs/architecture/database-viewer-api-and-deployment.md]).
  - [ ] Test dashboard loads and displays stats.
- [ ] Task 2: Book list and detail (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Book list with filters and search; link to book detail where applicable ([Source: docs/architecture/database-viewer-api-and-deployment.md]).
  - [ ] Call `GET /api/v1/books`, search, and `GET /api/v1/books/:id` from UI.
  - [ ] Desktop-first responsive admin experience ([Source: docs/architecture/database-viewer-api-and-deployment.md]).
- [ ] Task 3: Crawler status and logs view (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Dedicated view for crawler status and logs (or links to logs) using crawler API ([Source: docs/architecture/database-viewer-api-and-deployment.md]).
  - [ ] Test crawler view shows status/logs.
- [ ] Task 4: Responsive desktop UX (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Ensure UI is usable on desktop (responsive); follow basic semantics ([Source: docs/architecture/database-viewer-api-and-deployment.md], PRD UI goals).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Stories 2.1 and 2.2 deliver books/stats API and crawler/health API. This story adds the web UI that consumes those APIs.

### API Specifications

- All endpoints from 2.1 and 2.2: books (list, by id, search), stats, crawler (status, urls, logs), health. UI calls these from the browser (same origin or CORS configured).

### File Locations

- **Web UI:** `database-viewer/public/` (e.g. `index.html`); static assets served by Express ([Source: docs/architecture/database-viewer-api-and-deployment.md], [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]). **Entry:** `database-viewer/src/server.js`.

### Technical Constraints

- Vanilla JS / HTML/CSS per tech stack ([Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]). CORS and config externalized ([Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]).

### Testing

- Optional UI tests per testing strategy ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]). Manual verification of dashboard, book list, crawler view on desktop.
