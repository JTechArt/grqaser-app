# Story 8.3: Database management from internet

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** mobile user,
**I want** to load new catalog databases from a public file on the internet (e.g., GitHub), see loaded DBs in Settings (size, downloaded date, active), refresh to get a new version without overwriting the old one, remove DBs to free storage, and have all data reload when I load a new DB or change the active DB,
**so that** I can update the catalog and manage multiple DB versions safely.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Load from internet:** User can load a new database from a public URL (e.g., a file hosted on GitHub); the DB file is downloaded and stored in the app.
2. **Settings: list DBs:** In Settings, user sees all loaded databases with: size, downloaded date, and which one is **active**. Only the active DB is used for catalog data.
3. **Refresh:** A "Refresh" action fetches the new version of the DB from the internet and stores it **alongside** the existing one (does not overwrite the old DB).
4. **Remove DBs:** User can remove one or more DBs from Settings to free storage; the active DB cannot be removed until another is set active (or similar safeguard).
5. **Reload on change:** When the user loads a new DB or changes the active DB version, all catalog and related data in the app are reloaded from the newly active DB (e.g., home, search, library, book detail reflect the new data).
6. Existing flows (browse, search, play) continue to work after DB change; no stale data from the previous DB.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Create database manager service (AC: 1, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Create `src/services/databaseManager.ts` with methods: `loadDatabaseFromUrl(url)`, `listManagedDatabases()`, `setActiveDatabase(dbId)`, `refreshDatabase(dbId)`, `removeDatabase(dbId)`, `getActiveDatabase()`. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#GrqaserApp, architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Data-integration]
  - [ ] `loadDatabaseFromUrl(url)`: download the `.db` file from a public URL using `react-native-fs`/`expo-file-system`; save to a dedicated directory (e.g., `{DocumentDirectoryPath}/databases/{generatedId}.db`); record in `managed_databases` table via `appMetaRepository`; generate a display name from URL or file metadata; set as active if it is the first DB. [Source: architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Data-integration]
  - [ ] `refreshDatabase(dbId)`: fetch the source URL of the existing DB, download a new copy, store alongside the old one with a new ID/timestamp, record in `managed_databases`. Does NOT overwrite the original. [Source: architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Data-integration]
  - [ ] `removeDatabase(dbId)`: guard — cannot remove the active DB. Delete the `.db` file from disk and remove the row from `managed_databases`. [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema.md#managed_databases]
  - [ ] `setActiveDatabase(dbId)`: update `is_active` in `managed_databases` (set previous active to 0, new to 1); trigger catalog data reload via store dispatch. [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema.md#managed_databases]

- [ ] Task 2: Extend `appMetaRepository` for full `managed_databases` CRUD (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Ensure `managed_databases` table schema is created on app init (may already exist from Story 8.1 stub). [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema.md#managed_databases]
  - [ ] Implement full CRUD: `insertManagedDatabase(entry)`, `getAllManagedDatabases()`, `getActiveManagedDatabase()`, `setActiveManagedDatabase(dbId)`, `deleteManagedDatabase(dbId)`, `getManagedDatabaseById(dbId)`. [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema.md#managed_databases]

- [ ] Task 3: Extend `databaseSlice` for full DB management state (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  - [ ] Extend `src/state/slices/databaseSlice.ts` (created in 8.1) with state: `managedDatabases[]`, `activeDbId`, `isDownloading`, `downloadProgress`, `error`. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#GrqaserApp]
  - [ ] Async thunks: `loadNewDatabase(url)` — calls `databaseManager.loadDatabaseFromUrl()`, updates state, triggers reload. `refreshDb(dbId)` — calls `databaseManager.refreshDatabase()`. `switchActiveDb(dbId)` — calls `databaseManager.setActiveDatabase()`, dispatches catalog reload. `removeDb(dbId)` — calls `databaseManager.removeDatabase()`, updates list. `fetchManagedDatabases()` — loads list from DB on app init. [Source: architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Data-integration]

- [ ] Task 4: Implement catalog reload on DB change (AC: 5, 6)
  - [ ] Update `src/database/connection.ts` to support closing the current catalog DB connection and opening a new one when the active DB changes. [Source: architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Data-integration]
  - [ ] Update `catalogRepository.ts` to re-initialize from the newly active database file path after a switch. [Source: architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Data-integration]
  - [ ] After active DB change, dispatch reload actions for `booksSlice` (re-fetch all books from new DB), causing HomeScreen, SearchScreen, BookDetailScreen to re-render with new data. [Source: architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Data-integration]
  - [ ] Ensure no stale data: clear cached book data in state, re-query from new DB. [Source: architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Data-integration]

- [ ] Task 5: Build database management UI in Settings (AC: 2, 3, 4, 1)
  - [ ] In `SettingsScreen.tsx` (or `ProfileScreen.tsx`), add a "Catalog Databases" section per the design mockup. [Source: docs/design/grqaser-app/profile.html]
  - [ ] List all managed databases: each item shows name, "Active" badge (teal) for the active DB, size (e.g., "26 MB"), downloaded date (e.g., "Downloaded Feb 15, 2026"). [Source: docs/design/grqaser-app/profile.html]
  - [ ] Active DB item: show refresh button (circular icon). Non-active items: show "Set active" button and "Remove" button (trash icon). Active DB cannot be removed. [Source: docs/design/grqaser-app/profile.html]
  - [ ] "Load New Database from URL" button (teal-outlined, full width) at the bottom of the list. On tap, show a text input dialog/modal for the user to enter a public URL; validate URL format; dispatch `loadNewDatabase(url)`. [Source: docs/design/grqaser-app/profile.html]
  - [ ] Hint text: "Load catalog databases from a public URL (e.g., GitHub). Refresh fetches a new version alongside the current one." [Source: docs/design/grqaser-app/profile.html]
  - [ ] Show download progress indicator when loading/refreshing a DB. Show error messages on failure. [Source: architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Data-integration]

- [ ] Task 6: Write tests (AC: 1–6)
  - [ ] Unit tests for `databaseManager.ts`: mock file system and network; test load from URL, refresh (new copy alongside old), remove (guard active), set active. [Source: architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md#GrqaserApp]
  - [ ] Unit tests for `databaseSlice.ts`: test full state management (load, refresh, switch, remove, fetch list). [Source: architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md#GrqaserApp]
  - [ ] Unit tests for `appMetaRepository.ts` `managed_databases` full CRUD. [Source: architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md#GrqaserApp]
  - [ ] Integration test: load DB from URL → set active → verify catalog data reloads → switch to another DB → verify data changes → remove old DB. [Source: architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md#GrqaserApp]
  - [ ] Test that active DB cannot be removed (safeguard). [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema.md#managed_databases]
  - [ ] Run all existing tests and lint; no regressions. [Source: architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md#GrqaserApp]

## Dev Notes

### Dependencies on Previous Stories

- Story 8.1 must be completed: provides `database/connection.ts`, `database/catalogRepository.ts`, `database/appMetaRepository.ts` (with `managed_databases` stub), `databaseSlice.ts` (basic), and TypeScript types.
- Story 8.2 can be done in parallel with this story, but both depend on 8.1.

### Architecture — Database Management

- Users can load new catalog databases from a public URL. DB file is downloaded and stored locally. Multiple DB files can coexist. Only the active DB is used for catalog reads. [Source: architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Data-integration]
- Refresh downloads a new copy alongside the existing one (does not overwrite). Active DB cannot be removed until another is set active. [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema.md#managed_databases]
- When active DB changes, all catalog data reloads from the newly active DB. [Source: architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Data-integration]

### Data Model — `managed_databases` Table

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY (UUID or slug, e.g., `db-v1-20260215`) |
| display_name | TEXT | NOT NULL; user-visible label |
| source_url | TEXT | NOT NULL; public URL the DB was downloaded from |
| file_path | TEXT | NOT NULL; local file system path to `.db` file |
| file_size_bytes | INTEGER | NOT NULL |
| downloaded_at | TEXT | ISO-8601 timestamp |
| is_active | INTEGER | DEFAULT 0; only one row = 1 at a time |

Lives in the app metadata SQLite database (`grqaser_app_meta.db`).

### Design Mockup Reference — Settings DB Management

Per `docs/design/grqaser-app/profile.html`:

- **Section title:** "Catalog Databases" (uppercase, muted, group title style)
- **DB list items:** Each shows name (with "Active" badge for active), size + download date in muted text. Active item has teal background highlight. Active item shows refresh button only. Non-active items show "Set active" and "Remove" buttons.
- **Load button:** "Load New Database from URL" — full-width teal-outlined button below the list.
- **Hint text:** "Load catalog databases from a public URL (e.g., GitHub). Refresh fetches a new version alongside the current one."
