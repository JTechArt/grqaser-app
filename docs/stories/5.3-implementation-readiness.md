# Implementation Readiness: Story 5.3

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 5.3 — Deployment and runbooks  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-14

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. All referenced architecture docs exist; `docs/tasks/06-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` exists and can be referenced or summarized as specified.

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | testing-and-deployment-strategy, crawler-pipeline-and-data-contract, database-viewer-api-and-deployment, delivery-order-and-application-boundaries, coding-standards |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | Runbooks for crawler, database-viewer, GrqaserApp distribution; troubleshooting reference |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` point to real sections |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Builds on 5.1 and 5.2 |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Runbooks/docs | ✅ | `docs/` or per-app README; crawler, database-viewer, GrqaserApp each have run instructions |
| Troubleshooting | ✅ | `docs/tasks/06-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` exists — story references “e.g.” this path |

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: Crawler run instructions (env, DB path, schedule) | Task 1 | How to run full crawl and validate output |
| AC2: Database-viewer run instructions (port, DB path, CORS) | Task 2 | How to point at crawler DB and verify data |
| AC3: GrqaserApp store submission or internal distribution | Task 3 | Env and signing requirements |
| AC4: Known troubleshooting referenced or summarized | Task 4 | e.g. docs/tasks/06-TROUBLESHOOTING.md or equivalent; place in docs or runbook |

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- Config and env documented; no secrets in docs — [coding-standards.md](../architecture/coding-standards.md).

---

## 5. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 5.3 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependencies:** Stories 5.1 and 5.2 (test automation, GrqaserApp builds).  
- **Troubleshooting:** Referenced file `docs/tasks/06-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` exists. No blocking gaps.
