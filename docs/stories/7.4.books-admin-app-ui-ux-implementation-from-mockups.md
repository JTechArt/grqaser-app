# Story 7.4: Books-admin-app UI/UX implementation from mockups

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As an** operator,  
**I want** the books-admin-app web UI to match the design system and mockups in `docs/design/books-admin-app/`,  
**so that** the admin experience is consistent, clear, and aligned with the defined layout and patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Books-admin-app (layout, navigation, colors, typography, components) **matches or aligns with** the mockups in `docs/design/books-admin-app/` and the design system in `docs/design/README.md`.
2. Navigation and layout are consistent: sidebar (or equivalent), same sections (Dashboard, Books, Crawler, Databases); visual and interaction patterns (buttons, forms, cards) follow the design system.
3. No regression in existing behavior; key actions (start/stop crawler, set active DB, edit book) remain easy to find and use.
4. Optional: accessibility and keyboard use improved where low-effort.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Apply design system to books-admin-app (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Align colors with design system: slate background/text, teal accent (buttons, links, active nav), Plus Jakarta Sans typography, documented radii ([Source: docs/design/README.md], [Source: docs/architecture/books-admin-app-architecture.md]).
  - [ ] Update or add CSS (e.g. in `books-admin-app/public/`) to use design tokens or equivalent (background, surface, border, text, accent); ensure layout and components match or align with mockups in `docs/design/books-admin-app/`.
- [ ] Task 2: Navigation and layout (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Implement or update sidebar (or equivalent) with same sections as mockups: Dashboard, Books, Crawler, Databases; active state and links consistent with design system ([Source: docs/design/books-admin-app/], [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]).
  - [ ] Ensure visual and interaction patterns (buttons, forms, cards) follow design system; reference mockups for structure and styling.
- [ ] Task 3: No regression; key actions (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Verify start/stop crawler, set active DB, and edit book flows still work and are easy to find ([Source: docs/architecture/books-admin-app-architecture.md]).
  - [ ] Run existing books-admin-app tests; manual smoke test of crawler control, DB versioning, and data edit.
- [ ] Task 4: Optional accessibility (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Where low-effort: improve keyboard navigation and accessibility (focus order, labels, contrast) per design system and mockups.

## Dev Notes

### Prerequisites

- Story 7.3 (design system and mockups) must be complete so that `docs/design/README.md` and `docs/design/books-admin-app/` mockups exist ([Source: docs/prd/epic-7.md]).

### Design system reference

- **Colors:** Slate + teal (see `docs/design/README.md`). Background, surface, border, text, accent, accent hover/light ([Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]).
- **Typography:** Plus Jakarta Sans ([Source: docs/architecture/books-admin-app-architecture.md]).
- **Layout:** Sidebar navigation; sections Dashboard, Books, Crawler, Databases; book detail/edit as in mockups ([Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]).

### File locations

- **Web UI:** `books-admin-app/public/` — HTML, CSS, and client-side JS ([Source: docs/architecture/books-admin-app-architecture.md], [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]).
- **Mockup reference:** `docs/design/books-admin-app/` (dashboard, books, crawler, databases, book-detail) and `docs/design/README.md`.

### Technical constraints

- No change to API or data contract; UI-only updates. Existing behavior (crawler start/stop, DB versioning, book edit) must remain ([Source: docs/architecture/delivery-order-and-application-boundaries.md]).
- Vanilla JS/HTML/CSS per tech stack ([Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]).

### Testing

- Existing books-admin-app tests must pass. Manual verification: layout and navigation match mockups; key actions (start/stop crawler, set active DB, edit book) work ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]).
