# Implementation Readiness: Story 6.1

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 6.1 — books-admin-app merge and run  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-16

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. All referenced architecture docs exist; crawler and database-viewer codebases are present for merge; books-admin-app architecture defines run model and structure.

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | books-admin-app-architecture, crawler-pipeline-and-data-contract, database-viewer-api-and-deployment, source-tree, tech-stack, epic-6 (prd), testing-and-deployment-strategy |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | Single process (shared server or crawler subprocess); preserved crawler modes and viewer API/UI; config externalized; DB path deferred to 6.2 |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` and story refs point to real sections |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Epic 6 brownfield; consolidates Phase 1 + 2 into one app; no auth; local-only |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Crawler (source for merge) | ✅ | `crawler/src/crawler.js`, `crawler/src/config/crawler-config.js`, schema, models, utils — present |
| Database-viewer (source for merge) | ✅ | `database-viewer/src/server.js`, routes, config, models, `database-viewer/public/` — present |
| New app location | ✅ | Create `books-admin-app/` at repo root per source-tree and books-admin-app-architecture |
| Structure guidance | ✅ | src/ (server, crawler integration, routes), public/ (web UI), package.json; exact layout is implementation choice |

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: books-admin-app exists with merged code/behavior | Task 1–3 | New app; integrate crawler + viewer; preserve behavior |
| AC2: One process starts crawler + viewer/API | Task 1, 4 | Shared server or crawler as subprocess/library |
| AC3: Local only; no auth | Task 4 | No authentication implemented or required |
| AC4: Crawler and viewer behavior preserved | Task 2, 3 | Modes, SQLite writes; REST API books/stats/crawler/health; web UI |
| AC5: Config externalized; DB path for 6.2 | Task 5 | Port, logging, etc.; DB path placeholder |

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- Node.js LTS, Express 4.x, SQLite, Puppeteer; vanilla JS/HTML/CSS for UI. Reuse existing crawler and database-viewer stack. Single process; no auth; local-only. Keep crawler and viewer modules identifiable for rollback — [books-admin-app-architecture.md](../architecture/books-admin-app-architecture.md), [tech-stack.md](../architecture/tech-stack.md).

---

## 5. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 6.1 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependency:** None (first story of Epic 6). Crawler and database-viewer exist as separate apps to merge.  
- **No blocking gaps.** All refs and source paths verified.
