# Implementation Readiness: Story 3.2

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 3.2 — Navigation and core screens  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-14

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. All referenced architecture docs exist; GrqaserApp has `src/screens/` and `src/navigation/` (e.g. HomeScreen.tsx, RootNavigator.tsx).

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio, tech-stack, source-tree, testing-and-deployment-strategy |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | Tab + stack; Home, Search, Book detail, Profile/Settings; navigation types and deep linking |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` point to real sections |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Phase 3; builds on 3.1 |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Screens | ✅ | `GrqaserApp/src/screens/` exists (e.g. HomeScreen.tsx) |
| Navigation | ✅ | `GrqaserApp/src/navigation/` exists (e.g. RootNavigator.tsx, types.ts) |
| Stack | ✅ | React Navigation per tech stack |

---

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: Tab (or equivalent) + stack navigation | Task 1 | Main sections via tabs; stack for detail flows |
| AC2: Placeholder/minimal Home, Search, Book detail, Profile/Settings | Task 2 | Each reachable; Book detail receives id/params |
| AC3: Navigation types and deep linking considered | Task 3 | TypeScript types for routes/params; document or stub deep linking |

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- React Navigation (tabs + stack); TypeScript; single codebase iOS/Android — [tech-stack.md](../architecture/tech-stack.md).

---

## 5. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 3.2 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependency:** Story 3.1 (project setup and folder structure).  
- **No blocking gaps.** All refs and paths verified.
