# Implementation Readiness: Story 7.1

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 7.1 — Verify books-admin-app functional parity  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-17

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. Verification and documentation only; no new feature implementation. All referenced architecture and PRD docs exist; books-admin-app paths and Epic 1/2 behavior mappings are clearly specified.

---

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | books-admin-app-architecture, crawler-pipeline-and-data-contract, database-viewer-api-and-deployment, delivery-order-and-application-boundaries, source-tree, testing-and-deployment-strategy; epic-1, epic-2, epic-6 (prd), story 6.4 |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | Parity verification only; books-admin-app is single admin app; crawler runs from app (6.3), active DB (6.2); same pipeline and API as documented |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` and `[Source: docs/prd/...]` point to real sections |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Epic 7; prerequisite: Epic 6 complete; enables 7.2 removal and Epic 5 alignment |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| books-admin-app (subject of verification) | ✅ | `books-admin-app/src/server.js`, routes (books, stats, crawler, databases, health), config, crawler integration — present per Epic 6 |
| Parity document output | ✅ | Create under `docs/` (e.g. `docs/parity-books-admin-app.md`) or `docs/architecture/`; path not mandated in source-tree |
| Epic 1/2 PRD and stories | ✅ | docs/prd/epic-1.md, epic-2.md; story 6.4 referenced for view/edit — exist |

---

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: Crawler parity (Epic 1 behaviors via books-admin-app) | Task 1 | Metadata/audio (1.1), catalog/pagination (1.2), search/categories (1.3), cleaning/schema (1.4); crawler from app (6.3), config and active DB (6.2) |
| AC2: Database-viewer parity (Epic 2 + 6.2, 6.4) | Task 2 | Books/stats/crawler/health API; web UI; DB versioning and data view/edit |
| AC3: Parity documented and signed off | Task 3 | Single parity doc with AC-to-feature mapping; sign-off section; referenced from delivery order or Epic 7 |

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- No code changes required unless gaps found; gaps documented and either fixed here or logged as blockers for 7.2. Data contract and schema unchanged. Verification is manual or scripted (run app, call APIs, use web UI); existing books-admin-app and Epic 5 tests validate behavior — [delivery-order-and-application-boundaries.md](../architecture/delivery-order-and-application-boundaries.md), [testing-and-deployment-strategy.md](../architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md).

---

## 5. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 7.1 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependency:** Epic 6 complete (books-admin-app exists with crawler + viewer + DB versioning + data edit).  
- **No blocking gaps.** All refs and paths verified. Deliverable: parity document + sign-off so 7.2 and Epic 5 can proceed.
