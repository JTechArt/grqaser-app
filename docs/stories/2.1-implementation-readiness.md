# Implementation Readiness: Story 2.1

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 2.1 — Books API and stats API  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-14

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. All referenced architecture docs exist; database-viewer paths (server, config, routes, models) are present in the repo.

---

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | database-viewer-api-and-deployment, data-models-and-schema, source-tree, tech-stack, coding-standards, testing-and-deployment-strategy |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | Epic 2 starts after Epic 1; read-only DB; API base /api/v1; books and stats endpoints |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` point to real sections |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Phase 2 only; assumes crawler complete |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Entry | ✅ | `database-viewer/src/server.js` exists |
| Config | ✅ | `database-viewer/src/config/config.js` exists |
| Routes | ✅ | `database-viewer/src/routes/books.js`, `stats.js` exist |
| Models | ✅ | `database-viewer/src/models/database.js` exists (SQLite read-only) |
| API base | ✅ | Under `/api/v1` per database-viewer-api-and-deployment |
| Test layout | ✅ | `npm test` from `database-viewer/` |

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: GET /api/v1/books with pagination/filters | Task 1 | Pagination, filters (page, limit, category, author); JSON per data contract |
| AC2: GET /api/v1/books/:id | Task 2 | Single book or 404 |
| AC3: GET /api/v1/books/search?q=... | Task 2 | Search (title/author/description) |
| AC4: Stats endpoints (overview, authors, categories) | Task 3 | Counts/aggregates consistent with schema |

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- Express 4.x; read-only DB access; REST; consistent error formats and HTTP status codes; config (port, DB path, CORS) externalized — [tech-stack.md](../architecture/tech-stack.md), [coding-standards.md](../architecture/coding-standards.md).

---

## 5. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 2.1 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependency:** Epic 1 (crawler) complete; full catalog and documented schema.  
- **No blocking gaps.** All refs and paths verified.
