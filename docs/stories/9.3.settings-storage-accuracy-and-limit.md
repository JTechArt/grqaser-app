# Story 9.3: Settings Storage Data Accuracy and Storage Limit

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** mobile user,
**I want** the Settings page to show accurate storage and data usage and enforce a reasonable storage limit,
**so that** I can trust the displayed information and the app does not claim unrealistic storage capacity.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Catalog DB size accuracy:** The catalog database section in Settings shows the actual file size on disk (not the value from DB metadata which may be stale or wrong). For example, a ~3MB database should show ~3MB, not 184.7KB.
2. **Storage usage accuracy:** The "App Storage" section shows a reasonable allocated/total value representing app-specific storage, not the entire device filesystem (e.g., not 926.4 GB).
3. **Storage limit configuration:** The app enforces a configurable maximum storage limit (default: 10 GB) for app data (MP3 downloads + databases). The allocated storage shown in Settings reflects this limit, not the total device disk space.
4. **Mobile data usage accuracy:** DB Updates data usage counter accurately tracks bytes transferred when downloading databases (the current value should be verified against actual download sizes).
5. **Usage refresh:** Storage and data usage metrics refresh after downloads, cleanups, and DB operations.
6. No regression in existing Settings functionality (theme, downloads, DB management).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Fix catalog DB file size display (AC: 1)
  - [ ] In `databaseSlice.ts` or `databaseManager.ts`, when loading/inserting a managed database, calculate and store the actual file size using `RNFS.stat(filePath)` instead of relying on download content-length headers
  - [ ] After database download completes, update `fileSizeBytes` in the `managed_databases` table with `RNFS.stat(filePath).size`
  - [ ] In `fetchManagedDatabases`, verify each DB's `fileSizeBytes` against actual file size on disk (recalculate if mismatch)

- [ ] Task 2: Add configurable storage limit (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Add a `STORAGE_LIMIT_BYTES` constant (default: 10 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 = 10 GB) to `storageService.ts` or a config file
  - [ ] In `storageService.getStorageUsage()`, change `allocatedBytes` from `fsInfo.totalSpace` (entire device disk) to the configured storage limit
  - [ ] Update the percentage calculation to use the storage limit as the denominator
  - [ ] Optionally: block new downloads when used storage exceeds the limit, showing an appropriate alert

- [ ] Task 3: Fix getTotalDatabaseSize to use actual file sizes (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] In `appMetaRepository.ts`, `getTotalDatabaseSize()` sums `file_size_bytes` from the `managed_databases` table — ensure these values are accurate by updating them from disk when fetching
  - [ ] Consider adding a utility function that recalculates all managed DB sizes from `RNFS.stat()` and updates the DB records

- [ ] Task 4: Verify mobile data usage tracking (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Verify that `storageService.trackDataUsage('dbUpdates', bytes)` is called with accurate byte counts during DB downloads
  - [ ] Cross-reference the displayed "DB Updates" value with actual database file sizes downloaded
  - [ ] Fix any discrepancies in byte counting

- [ ] Task 5: Ensure metrics refresh after operations (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Verify `loadUsageMetrics()` is called after download, cleanup, and DB operations in `SettingsScreen.tsx` (already partially done, verify completeness)
  - [ ] Add refresh after `switchActiveDb` if not already present

- [ ] Task 6: Verify no regressions (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Test theme switching still works
  - [ ] Test download cleanup works and metrics update
  - [ ] Test DB load, refresh, set active, and remove all work correctly

## Dev Notes

### Root Cause Analysis

**Catalog DB size (184.7KB vs ~3MB):** The `fileSizeBytes` stored in the `managed_databases` table likely comes from the HTTP response `Content-Length` header during download. If the server uses compression (gzip/deflate) or the header is inaccurate, the stored size won't match the actual decompressed file on disk. The fix is to use `RNFS.stat(filePath).size` after download to get the true file size.

**Storage showing 926.4 GB:** `storageService.getStorageUsage()` at line 75 sets `allocatedBytes = fsInfo.totalSpace`, which is the entire device filesystem capacity. For a 1TB iPhone, this shows ~926 GB. Instead, the app should use a configurable storage limit (e.g., 10 GB) as the "allocated" value.

**Mobile data accuracy:** The `trackDataUsage('dbUpdates', bytes)` may not be called during all DB download operations, or the byte count may come from content-length rather than actual bytes transferred.

├── services/
│   └── storageService.ts       ← Fix allocatedBytes, add STORAGE_LIMIT
├── database/
│   └── appMetaRepository.ts    ← getTotalDatabaseSize() relies on stored values

### Key Code References

**storageService.ts** — lines 65–91: `getStorageUsage()` uses `fsInfo.totalSpace` for allocation:
```typescript
const allocatedBytes = fsInfo.totalSpace; // ← Bug: shows entire device disk
```

**SettingsScreen.tsx** — lines 253–256: Displays the storage usage:
```typescript
`${formatFileSize(storageUsage.usedBytes)} / ${formatFileSize(storageUsage.allocatedBytes)}`
```

**SettingsScreen.tsx** — line 412: Catalog DB size display:
```typescript
{formatFileSize(db.fileSizeBytes)} // ← Shows stale/inaccurate value from DB metadata
```

**appMetaRepository.ts** — line 228–233: `getTotalDatabaseSize()` sums from table:
```typescript
'SELECT COALESCE(SUM(file_size_bytes), 0) as total FROM managed_databases'
```

### Testing

- Verify catalog DB size matches actual file size (use device file inspector or `RNFS.stat()` in a debug log)
- Verify "App Storage" shows "X / 10.0 GB" instead of "X / 926.4 GB"
- Verify storage percentage calculation is correct against the 10 GB limit
- Verify DB Updates data usage matches actual download sizes
- Verify metrics refresh after each operation (download, cleanup, DB change)
