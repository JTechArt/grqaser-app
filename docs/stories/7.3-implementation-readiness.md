# Implementation Readiness: Story 7.3

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 7.3 — Design system and UI/UX mockups (books-admin-app and GrqaserApp)  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-17

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. All referenced architecture docs exist; target paths (`docs/design/README.md`, `index.html`, `books-admin-app/`, `grqaser-app/`) are defined in source-tree and architecture; design tokens (slate + teal, Plus Jakarta Sans) are specified in architecture. `docs/design/` already exists with README, hub, and mockup folders — story can be implemented or completed against this structure.

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | source-tree, books-admin-app-architecture, grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio, epic-7 (prd), testing-and-deployment-strategy |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | Design system: slate + teal, Plus Jakarta Sans; mockups under docs/design/; web vs mobile usage; no purple gradient for GrqaserApp; mobile frame (e.g. 390px), bottom tab |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` and `[Source: docs/prd/epic-7.md]` point to real sections |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Epic 7; no implementation in live apps; deliverables are static HTML and design doc only |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| docs/design/ | ✅ | Exists: README.md, index.html, books-admin-app/, grqaser-app/ with mockup HTML files (dashboard, books, crawler, databases, book-detail; home, book-detail, library, audio-player, profile) |
| Design system doc | ✅ | `docs/design/README.md` — create or update with colors, typography, radii, web vs mobile |
| Design hub | ✅ | `docs/design/index.html` — entry listing links to all mockup sections |
| Books-admin-app mockups | ✅ | `docs/design/books-admin-app/` — Dashboard, Books, Crawler, Databases, Book detail/edit |
| GrqaserApp mockups | ✅ | `docs/design/grqaser-app/` — Home, Book detail, Library, Audio player, Profile; same design rules; mobile frame; bottom tab nav |

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: Design system in docs/design/README.md (slate + teal, Plus Jakarta Sans, radii, web vs mobile) | Task 1 | Token table or equivalent; no purple gradient noted for GrqaserApp |
| AC2: Mockups under docs/design/; index.html = hub; books-admin-app/ and grqaser-app/ | Task 2 | Hub links to all sections; books-admin-app mockups with shared CSS and sidebar |
| AC3: GrqaserApp mockups same design rules; teal/slate; no purple; mobile frame; bottom tab | Task 3 | Same palette and typography; max-width 390px; bottom tab between views |
| AC4: Static HTML only; open index.html in browser to reach every mock; sidebar and bottom nav link to hub/pages | Task 4 | No backend; navigation verified manually |

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- Static HTML/CSS only; no backend. Manual verification: open `docs/design/index.html` in browser; click through every linked mock; confirm sidebar (web) and bottom nav (mobile) work and link back to hub or between pages. No automated tests required for static HTML — [testing-and-deployment-strategy.md](../architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md), [source-tree.md](../architecture/source-tree.md).

## 5. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 7.3 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependency:** None (can run in parallel with 7.1). Prerequisite for 7.4 and 7.5.  
- **No blocking gaps.** docs/design/ structure and architecture refs verified. If mockups already exist, story may be completion/refinement only.
