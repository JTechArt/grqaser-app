# Implementation Readiness: Story 5.1

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 5.1 — Crawler and database-viewer testing  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-14

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. All referenced architecture docs exist; crawler has tests (`src/tests/`); database-viewer test layout can be added or consolidated per story.

---

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | testing-and-deployment-strategy, tech-stack, source-tree |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | Phase order: crawler then viewer; single runnable suite; no Phase 2/3 tests assuming incomplete Phase 1/2 data |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` point to real sections |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Epic 5; focuses on crawler and database-viewer only |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Crawler tests | ✅ | `crawler/` (e.g. `src/tests/` or `*.test.js`); Jest; `npm test` from crawler/ |
| Database-viewer tests | ✅ | `database-viewer/`; add or consolidate per story |
| CI / single command | ✅ | Root or per-app npm scripts; document or add CI job |

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: Crawler unit (parsing/normalization) and integration (DB writes) | Task 1 | No HTML in text fields; required fields validated; `npm test` from crawler/ |
| AC2: Database-viewer tests for main API routes and health | Task 2 | Books, stats, crawler, health; optional UI tests |
| AC3: Single command (and CI) runs crawler and viewer tests | Task 3 | No Phase 2/3 tests assuming incomplete Phase 1/2 data |

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- Jest for crawler and viewer; Phase 1 and 2 tests must not depend on incomplete phase data — [tech-stack.md](../architecture/tech-stack.md), [testing-and-deployment-strategy.md](../architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md).

---

## 5. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 5.1 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependency:** Phase order; story covers crawler and database-viewer test automation.  
- **No blocking gaps.** All refs and paths verified.
