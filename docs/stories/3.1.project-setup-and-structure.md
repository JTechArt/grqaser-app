# Story 3.1: Project setup and structure

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** the React Native project initialized with a clear structure (screens, navigation, state, services),  
**so that** feature work can proceed in a consistent way.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. React Native app runs on iOS and Android (emulator/simulator).
2. Folder structure includes screens, navigation, state, services, types, and shared constants.
3. TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier are configured; path aliases work.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: React Native init and run (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Initialize React Native project in `GrqaserApp/` (or agreed app directory); ensure it runs on iOS and Android emulator/simulator ([Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md], [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]).
  - [ ] Verify build and run commands (e.g. `npx react-native run-ios`, `run-android`).
- [ ] Task 2: Folder structure (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create folder structure: screens, navigation, state, services, types, shared constants under `GrqaserApp/src/` ([Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md], [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]).
  - [ ] Document or leave clear placeholders so feature work can follow the same layout.
- [ ] Task 3: TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, path aliases (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Configure TypeScript throughout; ESLint and Prettier per project config ([Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md], [Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md]).
  - [ ] Configure path aliases (e.g. `@/screens`, `@/services`) and verify they resolve.
  - [ ] Run lint and format; fix any baseline issues.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Epic 3 starts only after Epic 2 (database-viewer) is complete and crawler data has been validated. GrqaserApp consumes crawler data via database-viewer API or export ([Source: docs/architecture/delivery-order-and-application-boundaries.md]).

### File Locations

- **App root:** `GrqaserApp/` (or equivalent). **Entry:** React Native app entry (e.g. `index.js`, `App.tsx`). **Source:** `GrqaserApp/src/` with screens, navigation, state, services, types, shared constants ([Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md], [Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md]).

### Technical Constraints

- React Native, TypeScript, single codebase for iOS and Android ([Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]). No GrqaserApp catalog/playback work before Phase 2 validation ([Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]).

### Testing

- Lint and test run from `GrqaserApp/` ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]). E2E later in Epic 5; this story focuses on setup and structure.
