# Story 3.2: Navigation and core screens

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to move between Home, Search, Book detail, and Profile/Settings,  
**so that** I can discover books and manage preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Tab (or equivalent) navigation for main sections; stack for detail flows.
2. Placeholder or minimal implementations for Home, Search, Book detail, Profile/Settings.
3. Navigation types are defined and deep linking is considered for future use.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Tab and stack navigation (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Implement tab (or equivalent) navigation for main sections; stack for detail flows ([Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md], [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md] — React Navigation).
  - [ ] Wire navigation so user can switch between main areas and drill into details.
- [ ] Task 2: Core screens placeholders (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create placeholder or minimal implementations for Home, Search, Book detail, Profile/Settings ([Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md]).
  - [ ] Each screen is reachable via navigation; Book detail receives id/params.
- [ ] Task 3: Navigation types and deep linking (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Define navigation types (e.g. TypeScript types for routes/params); consider deep linking for future use ([Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md]).
  - [ ] Document or stub deep-link handling if not fully implemented in MVP.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 3.1 delivers project setup and folder structure. This story adds React Navigation and the four core screens so data integration (3.3) and UI (3.4) can target them.

### File Locations

- **Screens:** `GrqaserApp/src/screens/`. **Navigation:** `GrqaserApp/src/navigation/` ([Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]). **Stack:** React Navigation 4.x ([Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]).

### Technical Constraints

- React Navigation (tabs + stack); TypeScript; single codebase iOS/Android ([Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]).

### Testing

- Manual navigation flow; unit/integration for navigation if applicable ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]). Run: `npm test` from `GrqaserApp/`.
