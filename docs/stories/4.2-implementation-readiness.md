# Implementation Readiness: Story 4.2

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 4.2 — Background playback and controls  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-14

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. All referenced architecture docs exist; implementation builds on 4.1 (core player) and configures track-player for background and system controls.

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio, tech-stack, source-tree, testing-and-deployment-strategy |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | Background playback; lock-screen (iOS) and notification (Android); interruptions and resume |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` point to real sections |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Builds on 4.1 |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Player config | ✅ | Wherever track-player and background/notification are configured (e.g. GrqaserApp/src/ services or app entry) |
| State | ✅ | Audio slice in store |

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: Audio continues in background; interruptions handled | Task 1 | Pause or duck and resume per platform (e.g. calls) |
| AC2: Lock-screen (iOS) and notification (Android) controls | Task 2 | Play/pause and optionally seek; configure per platform |
| AC3: Resume after interruptions | Task 3 | Call ended, app foregrounded; test on iOS and Android |

## 4. Technical constraints

- react-native-track-player; background and lock-screen behavior configured per platform — [tech-stack.md](../architecture/tech-stack.md), [grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md](../architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md).

## 5. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 4.2 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependency:** Story 4.1 (core player).  
- **No blocking gaps.** All refs verified.
