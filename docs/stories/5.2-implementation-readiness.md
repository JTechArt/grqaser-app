# Implementation Readiness: Story 5.2

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 5.2 — GrqaserApp testing and build  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-14

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. All referenced architecture docs exist; GrqaserApp has `android/`, `ios/`, and test/lint tooling per tech stack.

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | testing-and-deployment-strategy, tech-stack, source-tree |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | Component/unit and integration tests; E2E for critical path (e.g. play a book); iOS/Android build; signing and env documented |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` point to real sections |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Builds on Epics 3–4 for app under test |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| GrqaserApp | ✅ | `GrqaserApp/` with tests, `android/`, `ios/` |
| CI | ✅ | Root or GrqaserApp-specific config per testing-and-deployment-strategy |

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: Key components/flows tested; E2E for critical path | Task 1 | Jest, React Native Testing Library; `npm test`, `npm run lint` from GrqaserApp/ |
| AC2: iOS and Android build from repo; signing/env documented | Task 2 | TestFlight/internal distribution |
| AC3: Lint and test in CI | Task 3 | Document or add CI job for GrqaserApp |

## 4. Technical constraints

- Jest, React Native Testing Library; E2E for critical flows; ESLint, Prettier — [tech-stack.md](../architecture/tech-stack.md).

---

## 5. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 5.2 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependency:** Story 5.1 (crawler and viewer tests); app under test from Epics 3–4.  
- **No blocking gaps.** All refs and paths verified.
