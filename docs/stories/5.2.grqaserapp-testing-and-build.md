# Story 5.2: GrqaserApp testing and build

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** component/unit and integration tests for GrqaserApp and working iOS/Android builds,  
**so that** we can ship to TestFlight/Internal testing.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Key components and flows have unit/integration tests; critical path (e.g., play a book) has E2E where feasible.
2. iOS and Android build and run from the repo; signing and env config are documented.
3. Lint and test run in CI where applicable.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: GrqaserApp test coverage (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Key components and flows have unit/integration tests ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]).
  - [ ] Critical path (e.g. play a book) has E2E where feasible ([Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md] — Jest, React Native Testing Library).
  - [ ] Run: `npm test`, `npm run lint` from `GrqaserApp/` ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]).
- [ ] Task 2: iOS and Android builds (AC: 2)
  - [ ] iOS and Android build and run from repo ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]).
  - [ ] Document signing and env config for TestFlight/internal distribution ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]).
- [ ] Task 3: CI (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Lint and test run in CI where applicable ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]).
  - [ ] Add or document CI job for GrqaserApp.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 5.1 covers crawler and database-viewer tests. This story focuses on GrqaserApp tests and builds so the app can be shipped to TestFlight/internal testing.

### File Locations

- **GrqaserApp:** `GrqaserApp/` (tests, `android/`, `ios/`) ([Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]). **CI:** Root or GrqaserApp-specific config ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]).

### Technical Constraints

- Jest, React Native Testing Library; E2E for critical flows; ESLint, Prettier ([Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]).

### Testing

- Validate by running lint and test from `GrqaserApp/` and producing iOS/Android builds.
