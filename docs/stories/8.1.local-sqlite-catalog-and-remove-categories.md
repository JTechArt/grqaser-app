# Story 8.1: Local SQLite catalog and remove categories

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** mobile user / developer,
**I want** the app to load all catalog data from a local SQLite database with no network calls for catalog, and I want the categories section removed from the app,
**so that** the app works fully from local data and the UI no longer shows categories.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **No API for catalog:** Catalog data (books, search, metadata) is read only from a local database in the app; no network requests are made to load catalog or book list data.
2. **SQLite in app:** The books database is loaded and used locally (SQLite). If a different mobile DB type is required later, migration from SQLite to that DB is supported; all data is available for such migration.
3. **Categories removed:** The categories section is removed from the mobile app (navigation, filters, and any category-based UI are removed).
4. Existing browse, search, and book-detail flows work using the local DB only; no regression in core navigation or display.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Set up local SQLite infrastructure (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Install `react-native-sqlite-storage` (or `expo-sqlite`) and `react-native-fs` (or `expo-file-system`) dependencies; update `package.json` and run native link/pod install as needed. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#GrqaserApp]
  - [ ] Create `src/database/connection.ts` — module to open/close SQLite database connections. Accepts a file path to a `.db` file; returns a connection handle. Abstract behind a clean interface for future DB type migration. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#GrqaserApp, architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Data-integration]
  - [ ] Create `src/database/catalogRepository.ts` — repository/service interface that reads books, search results, and metadata from the active local SQLite database. Methods: `getAllBooks()`, `getBookById(id)`, `searchBooks(query)`, `getBookCount()`, `getStats()`. All reads go through this repository; no direct SQL elsewhere. [Source: architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Data-integration, architecture/data-models-and-schema.md#Books-table]
  - [ ] Create `src/database/appMetaRepository.ts` — repository for mobile-only metadata tables (`managed_databases`, `downloaded_mp3s`, `library_entries`). For this story, implement the `managed_databases` table schema creation and basic CRUD (list, get active, set active). Other tables can be stubs for now. [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema.md#GrqaserApp-mobile-specific-schemas]
  - [ ] Bundle a default catalog database file (e.g., `grqaser.db`) with the app or download on first launch; place in a known local path. Document the bundling approach. [Source: architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Data-integration]

- [ ] Task 2: Create Redux state for database management (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create `src/state/slices/databaseSlice.ts` — Redux slice managing: active database info, reload triggers, loading/error states. Actions: `setActiveDatabase`, `triggerReload`, `setLoading`, `setError`. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#GrqaserApp, architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Data-integration]
  - [ ] Update `src/state/index.ts` (or store configuration) to register the new `databaseSlice`. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#GrqaserApp]

- [ ] Task 3: Replace API calls with local DB reads (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Update `src/services/booksApi.ts` — replace all catalog/book-list API calls (`fetch`/`axios` calls to books-admin-app) with calls to `catalogRepository`. Retain streaming URL resolution (audio URLs still come from local DB `main_audio_url` / `chapter_urls` columns). [Source: architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Data-integration, architecture/coding-standards.md#Per-application-notes]
  - [ ] Update `src/state/slices/booksSlice.ts` — async thunks now call `catalogRepository` methods instead of API endpoints. Loading and error states still handled. [Source: architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Data-integration]
  - [ ] Verify `src/services/bookMapper.ts` works with data from SQLite (same schema as API response). Adjust mapping if column names differ from API response keys. [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema.md#Books-table]
  - [ ] Remove or disable API base URL configuration for catalog reads (keep for any non-catalog network calls if needed). [Source: architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Role-and-boundaries]

- [ ] Task 4: Define Epic 8 TypeScript types (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Add types to `src/types/book.ts`: `ManagedDatabase`, `DownloadedMp3`, `LibraryEntry`, `StorageUsage` — aligned with mobile-specific schemas in architecture. [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema.md#GrqaserApp-mobile-specific-schemas, architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Data-integration]

- [ ] Task 5: Remove categories from the app (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Remove `CategoryScreen.tsx` if it exists; remove any `CategoryCard.tsx` component. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Removed-Epic-8]
  - [ ] Remove categories from navigation (tab navigator, stack navigator, or any route definitions referencing categories). [Source: architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#UX-and-navigation]
  - [ ] Remove category-based filters, pills, or UI elements from HomeScreen or SearchScreen. The home screen shows "Featured" books with no category grouping per the design mockup. [Source: docs/design/grqaser-app/home.html]
  - [ ] Remove any Redux state, actions, or selectors related to categories from `booksSlice.ts` or equivalent. [Source: architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#UX-and-navigation]

- [ ] Task 6: Update Home and Search screens for local DB (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] HomeScreen: load featured books from `catalogRepository.getAllBooks()` (or a "featured" query); display in the book grid per existing mockup (no categories section). Stats row (Audiobooks count, E-books count, Favorites count) should read from local DB. [Source: docs/design/grqaser-app/home.html, architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#UX-and-navigation]
  - [ ] SearchScreen: full-text search over local SQLite database via `catalogRepository.searchBooks(query)`. Implement SQLite `LIKE` or FTS query. [Source: architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#UX-and-navigation]
  - [ ] BookDetailScreen: load book by ID from `catalogRepository.getBookById(id)`. Ensure metadata, audio URL, and cover image display correctly from local data. [Source: docs/design/grqaser-app/book-detail.html]

- [ ] Task 7: Verify no regression and write tests (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Write unit tests for `catalogRepository.ts` — test `getAllBooks`, `getBookById`, `searchBooks` against a test SQLite database. [Source: architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md#GrqaserApp]
  - [ ] Write unit tests for `databaseSlice.ts` — test actions and reducers. [Source: architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md#GrqaserApp]
  - [ ] Write unit tests for `appMetaRepository.ts` — test `managed_databases` CRUD. [Source: architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md#GrqaserApp]
  - [ ] Run all existing GrqaserApp tests (`npm test`, `npm run lint`); ensure no regressions. [Source: architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md#GrqaserApp]
  - [ ] Manual smoke test: browse → book detail → listen flow works using local DB only; no network calls for catalog data.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context (7.5)

- Story 7.5 (Done) aligned GrqaserApp UI to the design system (teal accent, slate palette, Plus Jakarta Sans). Theme tokens in `GrqaserApp/src/theme/index.ts`. Bottom tab nav: Home, Library, Player, Favorites, Profile. HomeScreen uses gradient `[accentLight, surface]`. BookCard, BookDetailScreen updated. Pre-existing Jest/transform issue with `react-native-gesture-handler` ESM in node_modules (not a blocker for unit tests). [Source: docs/stories/7.5]

### Architecture — Data Integration (Epic 8)

- **Data source changes to local SQLite.** The app ships with or downloads on first launch a catalog DB file. No API calls for catalog data. `catalogRepository` is the single point for reading catalog data. The DB layer is abstracted behind a repository/service interface for future migration to another DB type. [Source: architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Data-integration]
- **State:** Redux Toolkit with slices: books, audio, user, search, downloads, databaseManagement, library. Data services read from local SQLite. [Source: architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md#Data-integration]

### Data Models — Books Table Schema

The local SQLite database uses the same books table schema as the canonical crawler output:

| Column | Type | Key Notes |
|--------|------|-----------|
| id | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY |
| title | VARCHAR(500) | NOT NULL |
| author | VARCHAR(200) | DEFAULT 'Unknown Author' |
| description | TEXT | |
| duration | INTEGER | Total minutes |
| duration_formatted | TEXT | Display string (e.g., "0ժ 51ր") |
| type | VARCHAR(50) | DEFAULT 'audiobook' |
| language | VARCHAR(10) | DEFAULT 'hy' |
| category | VARCHAR(100) | DEFAULT 'Unknown' |
| rating | DECIMAL(3,2) | |
| rating_count | INTEGER | |
| cover_image_url | TEXT | |
| main_audio_url | TEXT | Validated URL |
| download_url | TEXT | Optional |
| file_size | INTEGER | |
| has_chapters | BOOLEAN | DEFAULT 0 |
| chapter_count | INTEGER | DEFAULT 0 |
| chapter_urls | TEXT | JSON array of per-chapter audio URLs |

[Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema.md#Books-table]

### Data Models — Mobile-Specific Schemas (Epic 8)

**managed_databases** table (for this story, basic setup):

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY (UUID or slug) |
| display_name | TEXT | NOT NULL |
| source_url | TEXT | NOT NULL |
| file_path | TEXT | NOT NULL |
| file_size_bytes | INTEGER | NOT NULL |
| downloaded_at | TEXT | ISO-8601 |
| is_active | INTEGER | DEFAULT 0; only one row = 1 |

These live in a **dedicated app metadata SQLite database** (`grqaser_app_meta.db`) separate from the catalog databases.

[Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema.md#GrqaserApp-mobile-specific-schemas]

### Epic 8 TypeScript Types

Define in `src/types/book.ts`:

- `ManagedDatabase` — aligned with `managed_databases` table
- `DownloadedMp3` — aligned with `downloaded_mp3s` table
- `LibraryEntry` — aligned with `library_entries` table
- `StorageUsage` — computed type (allocatedBytes, usedBytes, percentage, breakdown)

[Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema.md#TypeScript-client-types]
