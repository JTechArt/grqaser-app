# Implementation Readiness: Story 3.3

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 3.3 — State management and data integration  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-14

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. All referenced architecture docs exist; GrqaserApp has `src/store/` (slices: books, user, player), `src/services/`, `src/types/`. Story says “state”; repo uses “store”—equivalent.

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio, tech-stack, data-models-and-schema, database-viewer-api-and-deployment, source-tree, coding-standards, testing-and-deployment-strategy |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | Redux Toolkit; books, audio, user, search slices; API (list, by id, search); loading/error states; NFR4 network feedback |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` point to real sections |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Phase 3; builds on 3.1 and 3.2 |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| State/store | ✅ | `GrqaserApp/src/store/` with slices (booksSlice, userSlice, playerSlice, index) |
| Services | ✅ | `GrqaserApp/src/services/` (e.g. booksApi.ts) |
| Types | ✅ | `GrqaserApp/src/types/` (e.g. book.ts) |
| API consumption | ✅ | database-viewer API: GET /api/v1/books, /books/:id, /books/search?q=...; base URL configurable |

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: Redux Toolkit with slices (books, audio, user, search) | Task 1 | Types align with data-models-and-schema (e.g. Book) |
| AC2: Data services load books from database-viewer API | Task 2 | List, by id, search; base URL/config externalized |
| AC3: Loading/error states; data on Home and Search | Task 3 | Clear user feedback for errors; network failures per NFR4 |

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- Redux Toolkit; TypeScript; handle network and playback errors with clear user feedback — [coding-standards.md](../architecture/coding-standards.md), [grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md](../architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md).

---

## 5. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 3.3 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependencies:** Stories 3.1 and 3.2 (structure, navigation).  
- **Naming:** “State” = store/slices in repo; no blocking gap.
