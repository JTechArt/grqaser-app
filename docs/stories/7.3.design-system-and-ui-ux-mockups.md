# Story 7.3: Design system and UI/UX mockups (books-admin-app and GrqaserApp)

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** designer / developer,  
**I want** a single design system and static HTML mockups for both books-admin-app (web) and GrqaserApp (mobile) in the main docs folder,  
**so that** both applications share the same design rules, colors, and typography and we have a shared reference for implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Design system** is documented in `docs/design/README.md`: colors (slate + teal), typography (Plus Jakarta Sans), radii, and usage for web vs mobile.
2. **Mockups live under `docs/design/`** (main docs folder): `docs/design/index.html` is the design hub (entry to all mockups); `docs/design/books-admin-app/` contains HTML mockups for Dashboard, Books, Crawler, Databases, Book detail/edit; `docs/design/grqaser-app/` contains HTML mockups for Home, Book detail, Library, Audio player, Profile.
3. **GrqaserApp mockups** follow the same design rules and colors as books-admin-app (teal accent, slate background/text, no purple gradient); mobile frame (e.g. max-width 390px) and bottom tab navigation as appropriate.
4. All mockups are static HTML (no backend); opening `docs/design/index.html` in a browser allows navigating to every mock view. Sidebar (web) and bottom nav (mobile) link back to the design hub or between mock pages as appropriate.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Design system documentation (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create or update `docs/design/README.md` with design system: colors (slate + teal palette), typography (Plus Jakarta Sans), radii (e.g. 12px / 8px), and usage guidance for web vs mobile ([Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]).
  - [ ] Include token table or equivalent (background, surface, border, text, accent, accent hover/light) and note "no purple gradient" for GrqaserApp.
- [ ] Task 2: Design hub and books-admin-app mockups (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Ensure `docs/design/index.html` is the design hub: entry point listing links to all mockup sections (books-admin-app and grqaser-app) ([Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]).
  - [ ] Create or complete HTML mockups under `docs/design/books-admin-app/`: Dashboard, Books, Crawler, Databases, Book detail/edit. Use shared CSS (e.g. shared.css) and design tokens; sidebar navigation linking to these views and back to design hub.
- [ ] Task 3: GrqaserApp mockups — same design rules (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create or complete HTML mockups under `docs/design/grqaser-app/`: Home, Book detail, Library, Audio player, Profile ([Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md], [Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md]).
  - [ ] Apply same design system: teal accent, slate background/text, Plus Jakarta Sans; no purple gradient. Use mobile frame (e.g. max-width 390px) and bottom tab navigation linking between mock views and optionally back to design hub.
- [ ] Task 4: Static HTML and navigation (AC: 4)
  - [ ] All mockups are static HTML/CSS only (no backend). Verify opening `docs/design/index.html` in a browser allows navigating to every mock view ([Source: docs/prd/epic-7.md]).
  - [ ] Web mockups: sidebar links to Dashboard, Books, Crawler, Databases, Book detail/edit and back to hub. Mobile mockups: bottom nav links between Home, Book detail, Library, Player, Profile as appropriate; link back to hub where appropriate.

## Dev Notes

### Purpose

Deliver a single design system and static HTML mockups so that books-admin-app (Story 7.4) and GrqaserApp (Story 7.5) have a shared reference. No implementation in the live apps in this story ([Source: docs/prd/epic-7.md]).

### Design system (from architecture)

- **Colors:** Slate + teal. Background (e.g. slate-50), surface/card (white), border (slate-200), text (slate-900), muted text (slate-500), accent (teal-600), accent hover (teal-700), accent light (teal-100) ([Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md], [Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md]).
- **Typography:** Plus Jakarta Sans (Google Fonts or equivalent) ([Source: docs/architecture/books-admin-app-architecture.md], [Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md]).
- **Radii:** Document card and button radius (e.g. 12px, 8px) and usage for web vs mobile.

### File locations

- **Design system:** `docs/design/README.md` ([Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]).
- **Design hub:** `docs/design/index.html`.
- **Books-admin-app mockups:** `docs/design/books-admin-app/` — dashboard.html, books.html, crawler.html, databases.html, book-detail.html (or equivalent names).
- **GrqaserApp mockups:** `docs/design/grqaser-app/` — home.html, book-detail.html, library.html, audio-player.html, profile.html ([Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]).

### GrqaserApp mockup constraints

- Same design rules and colors as books-admin-app; no purple gradient ([Source: docs/prd/epic-7.md], [Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md]).
- Mobile frame (e.g. max-width 390px); bottom tab navigation ([Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md]).

### Testing

- Manual: open `docs/design/index.html` in a browser; click through every linked mock; confirm sidebar (web) and bottom nav (mobile) work and link back to hub or between pages. No automated tests required for static HTML ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]).
