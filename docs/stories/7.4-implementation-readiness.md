# Implementation Readiness: Story 7.4

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 7.4 — Books-admin-app UI/UX implementation from mockups  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-17

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. All referenced architecture and design docs exist; books-admin-app public UI path and design system (docs/design/README.md, docs/design/books-admin-app/) are specified; UI-only updates with no API or data contract change; existing behavior (crawler start/stop, DB versioning, book edit) must be preserved.

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | books-admin-app-architecture, source-tree, delivery-order-and-application-boundaries, tech-stack, testing-and-deployment-strategy; epic-7 (prd) |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | Design system: slate + teal, Plus Jakarta Sans; sidebar sections Dashboard, Books, Crawler, Databases; mockups in docs/design/books-admin-app/; UI in books-admin-app/public/ |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` and `[Source: docs/design/...]` point to real sections; docs/design/ exists |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Epic 7; depends on 7.3 (design system and mockups complete) |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| books-admin-app | ✅ | `books-admin-app/public/` — HTML, CSS, client-side JS; entry and routes in src/ |
| Mockup reference | ✅ | `docs/design/books-admin-app/` (dashboard, books, crawler, databases, book-detail) and `docs/design/README.md` — present |
| Design system | ✅ | Colors, typography, radii in docs/design/README.md; architecture references design system (Epic 7) |

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: books-admin-app matches or aligns with mockups and design system | Task 1 | Colors, typography, radii; CSS/tokens in public/; layout and components align with mockups |
| AC2: Navigation and layout consistent (sidebar, Dashboard/Books/Crawler/Databases); buttons, forms, cards follow design system | Task 2 | Sidebar with same sections; active state and links; visual patterns from mockups |
| AC3: No regression; start/stop crawler, set active DB, edit book easy to find and use | Task 3 | Existing tests pass; manual smoke test of crawler control, DB versioning, data edit |
| AC4: Optional accessibility and keyboard (low-effort) | Task 4 | Focus order, labels, contrast where low-effort |

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- **Prerequisite:** Story 7.3 complete so `docs/design/README.md` and `docs/design/books-admin-app/` mockups exist. No change to API or data contract; UI-only. Vanilla JS/HTML/CSS per tech stack. Existing behavior (crawler start/stop, DB versioning, book edit) must remain — [books-admin-app-architecture.md](../architecture/books-admin-app-architecture.md), [tech-stack.md](../architecture/tech-stack.md), [delivery-order-and-application-boundaries.md](../architecture/delivery-order-and-application-boundaries.md).

---

## 5. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 7.4 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependency:** Story 7.3 (design system and mockups) complete.  
- **No blocking gaps.** All refs and paths verified; docs/design/ and books-admin-app/ exist.
