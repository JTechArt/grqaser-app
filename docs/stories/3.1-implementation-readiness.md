# Implementation Readiness: Story 3.1

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 3.1 — Project setup and structure  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-14

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. All referenced architecture docs exist; GrqaserApp exists with `src/` layout (screens, navigation, store, services, types). Story uses “state”; repo uses `store/` (Redux)—equivalent per architecture.

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | tech-stack, source-tree, grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio, delivery-order, coding-standards, testing-and-deployment-strategy |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | Epic 3 after Epic 2; GrqaserApp consumes data via database-viewer API or export |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` point to real sections |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Phase 3; no catalog/playback before Phase 2 validation |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| App root | ✅ | `GrqaserApp/` exists |
| Entry | ✅ | React Native entry (e.g. index.js, App.tsx) |
| Source layout | ✅ | `GrqaserApp/src/` with screens, navigation, store (state), services, types; path aliases as configured |
| Note | ✅ | Repo uses `store/` (Redux) rather than folder name “state”; architecture allows equivalent |

---

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: App runs on iOS and Android (emulator/simulator) | Task 1 | React Native init in GrqaserApp/; verify run-ios, run-android |
| AC2: Folder structure (screens, navigation, state, services, types, constants) | Task 2 | Under GrqaserApp/src/; document or placeholders |
| AC3: TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, path aliases | Task 3 | Configure; path aliases (e.g. @/screens, @/services); lint and format |

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- React Native, TypeScript, single codebase iOS and Android; no GrqaserApp catalog/playback before Phase 2 validation — [tech-stack.md](../architecture/tech-stack.md), [coding-standards.md](../architecture/coding-standards.md).

---

## 5. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 3.1 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependency:** Epic 2 complete and crawler data validated.  
- **Naming:** “State” in story = Redux store under `src/store/` in repo; no blocking gap.
