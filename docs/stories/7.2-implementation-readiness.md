# Implementation Readiness: Story 7.2

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 7.2 — Remove crawler and database-viewer  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-17

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. All referenced architecture docs exist; post–Epic 7 layout (books-admin-app only, optional archive) is documented in source-tree and delivery-order; GrqaserApp API base and data contract are unchanged.

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | source-tree, books-admin-app-architecture, delivery-order-and-application-boundaries, grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio, testing-and-deployment-strategy; epic-7 (prd) |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | 7.1 must be complete and signed off; admin = books-admin-app only; optional archive/crawler, archive/database-viewer; root and CI reference books-admin-app only |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` point to real sections (post–Epic 7 updates already in place) |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Epic 7; runs after 7.1 parity sign-off; enables single admin entrypoint |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Remove or archive | ✅ | Top-level `crawler/` and `database-viewer/` — remove or move to e.g. `archive/crawler/`, `archive/database-viewer/` per team policy |
| books-admin-app | ✅ | Must remain only admin entrypoint; no broken dependency on standalone crawler/viewer (crawler in-process or subprocess per 6.1) |
| Root and CI | ✅ | package.json scripts, CI config; replace crawler/database-viewer refs with books-admin-app |
| Docs | ✅ | README, runbooks, docs/architecture, PRD/epic-5 — state books-admin-app replaces crawler and database-viewer |
| GrqaserApp | ✅ | Point at books-admin-app API; no references to database-viewer as separate service; config/env for API base if needed |

---

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: crawler and database-viewer removed or archived; books-admin-app only admin entrypoint | Task 1 | Delete or move dirs; confirm books-admin-app has no broken dependency; document only admin entrypoint |
| AC2: Root and CI reference books-admin-app only | Task 2 | Audit and update package.json, CI jobs, test commands |
| AC3: Documentation updated (README, runbooks, architecture, PRD) | Task 3 | No runbooks for running crawler or database-viewer as separate apps |
| AC4: GrqaserApp and consumers point at books-admin-app; data contract unchanged | Task 4 | Verify API base; schema unchanged |

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- **Prerequisite:** Story 7.1 (parity verification) complete and signed off. Data contract and schema unchanged; GrqaserApp continues to consume same API. If books-admin-app uses crawler as subprocess from `crawler/`, either move crawler code into books-admin-app or retain copy under `archive/crawler/` and point subprocess at archive until in-process migration — [delivery-order-and-application-boundaries.md](../architecture/delivery-order-and-application-boundaries.md), [source-tree.md](../architecture/source-tree.md).

---

## 5. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 7.2 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependency:** Story 7.1 complete and signed off.  
- **No blocking gaps.** Architecture already updated for post–Epic 7 layout. Smoke test: root scripts run; books-admin-app starts and serves API; GrqaserApp still reaches API.
