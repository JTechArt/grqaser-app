# Implementation Readiness: Story 7.5

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 7.5 — GrqaserApp UI/UX implementation from mockups  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-17

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. All referenced architecture and design docs exist; GrqaserApp src layout (screens, navigation, state/store, services, types) and design system (docs/design/README.md, docs/design/grqaser-app/) are specified; UI/theme updates only; API base remains books-admin-app; data contract unchanged; existing browse → book detail → listen flow must be preserved.

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio, source-tree, delivery-order-and-application-boundaries, tech-stack, testing-and-deployment-strategy; epic-7 (prd) |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | Design system: teal accent, slate palette, Plus Jakarta Sans; no purple gradient; bottom tab; mobile frame (390px); mockups in docs/design/grqaser-app/; API base books-admin-app |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` and `[Source: docs/design/...]` point to real sections; docs/design/ exists |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Epic 7; depends on 7.3 (design system and mockups complete) |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| GrqaserApp | ✅ | `GrqaserApp/src/` — screens, navigation, store (state), services, types; theme/design tokens where applicable |
| Mockup reference | ✅ | `docs/design/grqaser-app/` (home, book-detail, library, audio-player, profile) and `docs/design/README.md` — present |
| Design system | ✅ | Teal accent, slate palette, Plus Jakarta Sans (or RN equivalent); no purple gradient; bottom tab; mobile frame per grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio and docs/design |

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: GrqaserApp matches or aligns with mockups and design system (teal, slate, Plus Jakarta Sans) | Task 1 | Theme/constants; design tokens; no purple gradient; align with docs/design/grqaser-app/ |
| AC2: Core screens (Home, Search, Book detail, Audio player, Library, Profile) and bottom tab nav per mockups | Task 2 | Structure and patterns from mockups; bottom tab clear; same sections as mockups |
| AC3: No regression; browse → book detail → listen flow intact | Task 3 | Existing tests pass; manual smoke test; API and playback unchanged |
| AC4: Optional dark/light theme and accessibility (low-effort) | Task 4 | Where low-effort per design system |

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- **Prerequisite:** Story 7.3 complete so `docs/design/README.md` and `docs/design/grqaser-app/` mockups exist. React Native, TypeScript; Redux Toolkit; API base remains books-admin-app. No change to data contract or API. Data contract and schema unchanged — [grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md](../architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md), [tech-stack.md](../architecture/tech-stack.md), [delivery-order-and-application-boundaries.md](../architecture/delivery-order-and-application-boundaries.md).

## 5. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 7.5 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependency:** Story 7.3 (design system and mockups) complete.  
- **No blocking gaps.** All refs and paths verified; docs/design/ and GrqaserApp/ exist. GrqaserApp uses `store/` (Redux) in repo; story says "state" — equivalent per architecture.
