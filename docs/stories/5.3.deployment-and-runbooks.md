# Story 5.3: Deployment and runbooks

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As an** operator,  
**I want** clear steps to run the crawler, database-viewer, and (where applicable) GrqaserApp distribution,  
**so that** the system can be deployed and updated safely.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Crawler run instructions (env, DB path, schedule if any) are documented.
2. Database-viewer run instructions (port, DB path, CORS) are documented.
3. GrqaserApp store submission (or internal distribution) steps and requirements are documented.
4. Known troubleshooting (e.g., from docs/tasks/06-TROUBLESHOOTING.md) is referenced or summarized.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Crawler runbook (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Document crawler run instructions: env, DB path, schedule (if any) ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]).
  - [ ] Include how to run full crawl and validate output ([Source: docs/architecture/crawler-pipeline-and-data-contract.md]).
- [ ] Task 2: Database-viewer runbook (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Document database-viewer run instructions: port, DB path, CORS ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md], [Source: docs/architecture/database-viewer-api-and-deployment.md]).
  - [ ] Include how to point at crawler DB and verify data ([Source: docs/architecture/delivery-order-and-application-boundaries.md]).
- [ ] Task 3: GrqaserApp distribution (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Document GrqaserApp store submission or internal distribution steps and requirements ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]).
  - [ ] Include env and signing requirements ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]).
- [ ] Task 4: Troubleshooting (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Reference or summarize known troubleshooting (e.g. from `docs/tasks/06-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` or equivalent) ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]).
  - [ ] Place in docs or runbook so operators can find it.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Stories 5.1 and 5.2 cover test automation and GrqaserApp builds. This story delivers operator-facing runbooks and deployment docs so the system can be run and updated safely.

### File Locations

- **Runbooks/docs:** `docs/` or per-app README; crawler, database-viewer, GrqaserApp each have run instructions ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]). **Troubleshooting:** `docs/tasks/06-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` or equivalent if present.

### Technical Constraints

- Config and env documented; no secrets in docs ([Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]).

### Testing

- Validate by following documented steps (crawler run, viewer run, app distribution) and confirming they work.
