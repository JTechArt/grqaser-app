# Story 5.3: Deployment and runbooks

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As an** operator,  
**I want** clear steps to run books-admin-app and (where applicable) GrqaserApp distribution,  
**so that** the system can be deployed and updated safely.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Books-admin-app run instructions are documented (port, DB path, env, how to start/stop crawler and use DB versioning per Epic 6).
2. Crawler run is documented as part of books-admin-app (start/stop and config via app per 6.3); no separate standalone crawler runbook.
3. GrqaserApp store submission (or internal distribution) steps and requirements are documented.
4. Known troubleshooting (e.g., from docs/tasks/06-TROUBLESHOOTING.md) is referenced or summarized.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Books-admin-app runbook (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Document books-admin-app run instructions: port, DB path, env, logging ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md], [Source: docs/prd/epic-6.md]).
  - [ ] Document crawler as part of books-admin-app: start/stop and config via app (Story 6.3); no separate crawler runbook ([Source: docs/prd/epic-5.md]).
  - [ ] Include how to run full crawl and validate output via books-admin-app ([Source: docs/architecture/crawler-pipeline-and-data-contract.md]).
- [ ] Task 2: GrqaserApp distribution (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Document GrqaserApp store submission or internal distribution steps and requirements ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]).
  - [ ] Include env and signing requirements ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]).
- [ ] Task 3: Troubleshooting (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Reference or summarize known troubleshooting (e.g. from `docs/tasks/06-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` or equivalent) ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]).
  - [ ] Place in docs or runbook so operators can find it.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Stories 5.1 and 5.2 cover books-admin-app test automation and GrqaserApp builds. This story delivers operator-facing runbooks and deployment docs. Books-admin-app is the single admin app; crawler and database-viewer are not run as separate apps (see Epic 7 for their removal).

### File Locations

- **Runbooks/docs:** `docs/` or per-app README; books-admin-app and GrqaserApp have run instructions ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md], [Source: docs/prd/epic-5.md]). **Troubleshooting:** `docs/tasks/06-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` or equivalent if present.

### Technical Constraints

- Config and env documented; no secrets in docs ([Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]).

### Testing

- Validate by following documented steps (crawler run, viewer run, app distribution) and confirming they work.
