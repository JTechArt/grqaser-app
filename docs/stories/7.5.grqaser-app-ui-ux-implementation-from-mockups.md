# Story 7.5: GrqaserApp UI/UX implementation from mockups

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** mobile user / developer,  
**I want** GrqaserApp (React Native) to follow the same design system and mockups in `docs/design/grqaser-app/`,  
**so that** the mobile experience is visually and behaviorally consistent with the design system and matches the mockups (Home, Book detail, Library, Player, Profile).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GrqaserApp (colors, typography, components, navigation) **matches or aligns with** the mockups in `docs/design/grqaser-app/` and the design system in `docs/design/README.md` (teal accent, slate palette, Plus Jakarta Sans or equivalent).
2. Core screens (Home, Search, Book detail, Audio player, Library/Profile) follow the structure and patterns shown in the mockups; bottom tab (or equivalent) navigation is clear.
3. No regression in existing behavior; browse → book detail → listen flow remains intact.
4. Optional: theme (dark/light) and accessibility improvements where low-effort.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Apply design system to GrqaserApp (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Align colors with design system: teal accent, slate palette, Plus Jakarta Sans (or React Native equivalent font) ([Source: docs/design/README.md], [Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md]).
  - [ ] Update theme/constants so components use design tokens (background, surface, text, accent); ensure no purple gradient; match or align with mockups in `docs/design/grqaser-app/`.
- [ ] Task 2: Core screens and bottom tab navigation (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Update Home, Search, Book detail, Audio player, Library, Profile screens to follow structure and patterns in mockups ([Source: docs/design/grqaser-app/], [Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md]).
  - [ ] Ensure bottom tab (or equivalent) navigation is clear and matches mockup layout; same sections as mockups (e.g. Home, Library, Profile and appropriate stack for Book detail / Player).
- [ ] Task 3: No regression; browse → book detail → listen (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Verify browse → book detail → listen flow remains intact; existing API integration and playback behavior unchanged ([Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md]).
  - [ ] Run existing GrqaserApp tests; manual smoke test on target device or simulator.
- [ ] Task 4: Optional theme and accessibility (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Where low-effort: dark/light theme and accessibility improvements (contrast, labels, focus) per design system.

## Dev Notes

### Prerequisites

- Story 7.3 (design system and mockups) must be complete so that `docs/design/README.md` and `docs/design/grqaser-app/` mockups exist ([Source: docs/prd/epic-7.md]).

### Design system reference

- **Colors:** Teal accent, slate palette; no purple gradient ([Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md], [Source: docs/design/README.md]).
- **Typography:** Plus Jakarta Sans or equivalent in React Native ([Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md]).
- **Mobile:** Bottom tab navigation; mobile frame (mockups use max-width 390px as reference) ([Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md]).

### File locations

- **GrqaserApp:** `GrqaserApp/src/` — screens, navigation, state, services, types; theme/design tokens where applicable ([Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md], [Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md]).
- **Mockup reference:** `docs/design/grqaser-app/` (home, book-detail, library, audio-player, profile) and `docs/design/README.md`.

### Technical constraints

- React Native, TypeScript; state via Redux Toolkit; API base remains books-admin-app. No change to data contract or API ([Source: docs/architecture/delivery-order-and-application-boundaries.md], [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]).
- Data contract and schema unchanged ([Source: docs/architecture/grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio.md]).

### Testing

- Existing GrqaserApp tests must pass. Manual verification: screens match or align with mockups; browse → book detail → listen flow works ([Source: docs/architecture/testing-and-deployment-strategy.md]).
