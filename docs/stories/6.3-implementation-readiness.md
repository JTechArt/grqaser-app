# Implementation Readiness: Story 6.3

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 6.3 — Crawler start/stop and config management  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-16

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. Architecture defines crawler control (start/stop), config view/edit, alignment with active DB path; existing crawler config and status/logs behavior is documented.

---

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | books-admin-app-architecture, crawler-pipeline-and-data-contract, database-viewer-api, epic-6, testing-and-deployment-strategy |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | Start/stop via API and UI; config (mode, DB path, rate limits, timeouts) viewable/editable; active path from 6.2; status/logs preserved |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` and story refs point to real sections |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Builds on 6.1 (merged app) and 6.2 (active path); config applies to subsequent runs |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Implementation location | ✅ | Within `books-admin-app/`: routes for crawler start/stop, config GET/PUT; UI for control and config form |
| Crawler entry (reference) | ✅ | `crawler/src/crawler.js`, `crawler/src/config/crawler-config.js` — behavior to preserve or invoke from books-admin-app |
| Status/logs | ✅ | Reuse merged viewer crawler status/logs API and UI |

---

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: Start and stop crawler from app (UI and/or API) | Task 1 | POST start/stop; one run at a time or defined policy; graceful stop |
| AC2: Crawler config manageable (view and edit) | Task 2 | GET/PUT config; persist; apply to subsequent runs; validate |
| AC3: Config includes active DB path (6.2) | Task 3 | Crawler runs write to current active path; config reflects active on next run |
| AC4: Crawler status and logs visible in app | Task 4 | Build on existing viewer crawler monitoring; running/stopped; logs stream or refresh |

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- Crawler may run in-process or as subprocess (per 6.1); start/stop must match (spawn/kill or start/abort). Config: mode, DB path, rate limits, timeouts; base + environments[NODE_ENV] merge per crawler-pipeline. Active path from 6.2 — [books-admin-app-architecture.md](../architecture/books-admin-app-architecture.md), [crawler-pipeline-and-data-contract.md](../architecture/crawler-pipeline-and-data-contract.md).

---

## 5. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 6.3 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependency:** Stories 6.1 (books-admin-app, merged crawler + viewer) and 6.2 (active/backup DB versioning).  
- **No blocking gaps.** All refs and integration points clear.
