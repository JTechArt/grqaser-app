# Implementation Readiness: Story 4.1

**See also:** [Implementation readiness for all stories](./implementation-readiness-all-stories.md).

**Story:** 4.1 — Core audio player  
**Checked by:** Architect (Winston)  
**Date:** 2025-02-14

## Verdict: **READY**

The story is implementation-ready for the Dev agent. All referenced architecture docs exist; GrqaserApp has store (player slice), screens, and crawler-backed data model for main_audio_url.

## 1. Architecture and reference integrity

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| All cited architecture docs exist | ✅ | grqaserapp-data-integration-and-audio, data-models-and-schema, tech-stack, source-tree, coding-standards, testing-and-deployment-strategy |
| Dev Notes match architecture content | ✅ | main_audio_url (and download_url); react-native-track-player; play/pause, seek, progress, duration |
| Source references accurate | ✅ | `[Source: docs/architecture/...]` point to real sections |
| Phase scope correct | ✅ | Epic 4 depends on Epic 3; Home and Book detail (3.4) ready for Play |

---

## 2. File and project structure

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Screens/components | ✅ | `GrqaserApp/src/screens/` (player screen/components) |
| State | ✅ | Audio slice in `GrqaserApp/src/store/` (e.g. playerSlice.ts) |
| Data | ✅ | Audio URLs from crawler-backed data (book main_audio_url) |

## 3. Acceptance criteria and tasks

| AC | Covered by tasks | Notes |
|----|------------------|--------|
| AC1: Playback from crawler-backed audio URLs | Task 1 | main_audio_url or equivalent; react-native-track-player per tech stack |
| AC2: Play/pause, seek, progress/duration | Task 2 | Wire to Redux audio slice; work correctly |
| AC3: Player UI (full-screen and/or mini) | Task 3 | Clear and responsive; connected to player state |

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- react-native-track-player (or equivalent) for streaming; iOS and Android single codebase; handle playback errors with clear user feedback — [tech-stack.md](../architecture/tech-stack.md), [coding-standards.md](../architecture/coding-standards.md).

---

## 5. Summary

- **Implementation readiness:** **GO** — Story 4.1 is ready for the Dev agent.  
- **Dependency:** Epic 3 (Home and Book detail from 3.4).  
- **No blocking gaps.** All refs and paths verified.
